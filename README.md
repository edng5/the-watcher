## Introduction:

The Google Gemini Long Context Competition on Kaggle focuses on recommending the most relevant MCU movies, allowing viewers to save time while staying informed about the main storyline. This approach leverages Gemini's 2-million-token context window and content caching capabilities to create a tool for casual MCU fans, enabling them to skip watching all 34 movies and 11 TV shows while still grasping the core narrative.

## Methods:

The project uses web scraping and a Kaggle dataset of MCU transcripts as input to answer key questions, such as whether a story is essential to the overall MCU narrative, which movies serve as prerequisites, and key plot points to note for future developments.

## Conclusion: 
Gemini effectively analyzed the provided transcripts and successfully recommended movies, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for processing extensive inputs.
