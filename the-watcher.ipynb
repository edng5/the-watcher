With 34 movies (and counting) of \ncomplex intertwining plots, I want to know which are worth watching and which movies are prerequisites to fully understand the movie. The Watcher (much like the one in the MCU) will provide breakdown on why to invest in watching this movie\nand key plot points in movie to be excited for in the future MCU.\n\nUtilizing Gemini's 2M context window, I can show it an entire transcript of a movie. This notebook demonstrates Gemini's ability to:\n\n1. Identify long context windows and extract information from it,\n2. Provide suggestions based on the given information and context caching\n3. And predict what could be important in the foreseeable future.\n\nNote: I took two approaches - one was to webscrape for a transcript and the other was to use an existing Kaggle dataset containing 18 MCU transcripts.

Very well, let's dissect these queries based on the provided context and my vast knowledge of the multiverse.\n\nThe context you provided is a transcript from *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law*.  While entertaining and introducing new characters like Skaar, She-Hulk's story is, thus far, largely self-contained. It doesn't significantly impact the main MCU timeline or the overarching narrative of the Infinity Saga and its aftermath.  While a fun legal-comedy romp, it's less crucial for understanding the broader MCU narrative than, say, *WandaVision*, which directly sets up events in *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* and deals with the emotional fallout of *Avengers: Endgame*.\n\nTherefore, based on relevance to the core MCU timeline, *WandaVision* takes precedence over *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law*.  She-Hulk's adventures, while amusing, can be viewed as supplemental rather than essential viewing for understanding the major events impacting the universe.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Which other movies and series should I watch before only the relevant movies so that I fully understand the plot?\nYou've provided transcripts for *WandaVision* and *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law*.  As I stated previously, *She-Hulk*, while entertaining, is not crucial for understanding the main MCU timeline.  Therefore, to understand *WandaVision* fully, here's what you need to watch:\n\n* **Avengers: Age of Ultron:** This introduces Wanda and Vision and establishes their relationship.\n* **Captain America: Civil War:** Shows the growing tension between the Avengers and the Sokovia Accords' impact on Wanda and Vision.\n* **Avengers: Infinity War:** This crucial film features Vision's death at the hands of Thanos and Wanda's grief.\n* **Avengers: Endgame:**  The culmination of the Infinity Saga sees the aftermath of Thanos's snap and the five-year blip, which heavily influences Wanda's state of mind going into *WandaVision.*\n\nYou do *not* need to watch *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law* to understand *WandaVision.*  While Bruce Banner appears in both, his appearance in *She-Hulk* does not significantly impact his character arc in *WandaVision.*\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Which key points, from the ones that you picked, do you think are major plot points in the future based on the comics?\nFrom the *WandaVision* transcript, several key points have major implications for the future of the MCU, based on my knowledge of the comics:\n\n* **Wanda's embrace of the Scarlet Witch identity and Chaos Magic:** This is HUGE. In the comics, the Scarlet Witch is a being of immense power, capable of reality-warping feats.  Her instability and connection to Chaos Magic have led to catastrophic events, like *House of M*.  This sets her up as a potentially major player, and possibly a threat, in future MCU phases.\n* **The Darkhold's influence:** The Darkhold, the book of the damned, corrupts those who use it.  Agatha's mention of a chapter devoted to Wanda foreshadows the dangers of this book and Wanda's potential for further corruption and unpredictable actions.  Its presence in the MCU is a significant development.\n* **Vision's \"rebirth\" and the Ship of Theseus discussion:**  While this version of Vision fades, the concept of Vision's identity and the possibility of his return in some form is now established. White Vision, possessing Vision's original data, is out there, and his story is far from over.\n* **Wanda hearing the twins' voices in the post-credit scene:**  This directly ties into the comics and implies that Billy and Tommy may still exist somewhere, potentially setting up storylines involving the Young Avengers or other future projects.\n\nThese elements from *WandaVision* are far more significant to the overarching MCU narrative than anything presented in the *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law* transcript.  While *She-Hulk* introduces interesting characters, they haven't yet shown the same potential for widespread impact on the main storyline.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":27},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Modifying Prompt to Avoid Spoilers\n\nThe above use case includes spoilers and would not be helpful in an actual scenario.

This series has direct consequences for the wider MCU, exploring Wanda's grief and the emergence of the Scarlet Witch. The events in Westview have repercussions that ripple outward, impacting future films like *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness*.\n\n**She-Hulk: Attorney at Law**, while entertaining, is *less crucial* to the central MCU timeline.  It introduces new characters and explores themes of self-acceptance, but its connections to the broader narrative are less significant than WandaVision's.  While it features cameos and references to larger events, the core conflict and resolution are mostly self-contained.  You could skip this one for now and not miss any essential plot points for the main storyline.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Which other movies and series should I watch before only the relevant movies so that I fully understand the plot?\nTo fully understand WandaVision, you should watch these movies and series in this order:\n\n1. **Avengers: Age of Ultron:** This introduces Wanda and Vision and sets up their relationship, as well as the origins of Wanda's powers.\n2. **Captain America: Civil War:** This movie explores the fallout from *Age of Ultron* and further develops Wanda and Vision's relationship and the political climate surrounding enhanced individuals.\n3. **Avengers: Infinity War:** This is crucial for understanding Wanda's emotional state and her connection to Vision leading into *WandaVision*.  It deals with Thanos' quest for the Infinity Stones and the significant sacrifices made.\n4. **Avengers: Endgame:**  This movie deals with the aftermath of *Infinity War* and shows the universe struggling to cope with Thanos' actions. This context is important for understanding Wanda's grief in *WandaVision*.\n\nYou can skip *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law* for now. While it's in the MCU, it doesn't have significant ties to Wanda's story or *WandaVision*.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion: Which key points, from the ones that you picked, do you think are major plot points in the future based on the comics?\nBased on the *WandaVision* transcript and my knowledge of the comics, these are the key plot points that will likely have major repercussions in the future of the MCU:\n\n* **Wanda becoming the Scarlet Witch:**  The culmination of Wanda's grief and the unlocking of her full potential as the Scarlet Witch has significant implications. In the comics, the Scarlet Witch is a being of immense power, capable of altering reality itself. This transformation will likely be a driving force in future storylines.\n\n* **The Darkhold's influence:**  Agnes mentions the Darkhold, a book of dark magic.  This book's presence suggests a darker path for Wanda and potentially other magic users in the MCU. Its corrupting influence could lead to dangerous consequences.\n\n* **Wanda's children's fate:**  While Wanda releases the citizens of Westview, her children, Billy and Tommy, disappear as the Hex fades.  In the comics, these children have a complicated history, linked to powerful magical forces.  Their apparent vanishing will undoubtedly play a role in Wanda's future and could have ties to other mystical elements of the MCU.\n\n* **Vision's return and White Vision:**  The creation of \"White Vision\" and the restoration of Vision's memories by the original Hex Vision sets up interesting possibilities. The existence of two Visions, one seemingly devoid of emotion and the other potentially carrying the original's memories and love for Wanda, will likely be explored in future storylines.\n\n\nThese elements have deep roots in the comics and are now established within the MCU.  I foresee their continued development and influence on the broader narrative.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":29},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\n\nWhile this experiments on the MCU, it can be applied to many other movies as well.
